# Stantler: ANTLR Compatible Parser Generator for Common Lisp

Stantler is an ANTLR compatible lexer / parser generator for Common Lisp.
It creates parser functions from ANTLR4 description files.

Stantler is currently under development. It is neither fast nor feature complete.
Contributions are welcome.

## Disclaimer

I have no idea what I'm doing.

## Documentation

Use read macros in language actions at your own risk.
As a result of ANTLR's match longest semantics, Lisp code may be read any number
of times.
